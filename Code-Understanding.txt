HOW IT WORKS?------>ALSO INCLUDED IN MAIN.C FILE AT TOP.

We have 3 Buses, each with 12 seats so Total Passengers = Buses x Seats = 3 x 12=36
We have made an array for these 36 passengers, having PassengerIDs randomly.
We have a global array which stores all data (BEFORE BOOKING ALL ZERO)(INDEX 1 TO 12 FOR BUS1) (INDEX 21 TO 32 FOR BUS2) (INDEX 41 TO 52 FOR BUS3) , INDEX 59 STORES MACHINEID(RANDOMLY GENERTED) AND INDEX 60 HAS PASSENGER ID FROM ARRAY
A for loop is run 36 times (once for each passenger), in for loop we have 5 Threads/Machines which are selected randomly by random number generator.
When a thread is selected the function AssignSeats is executed.

In assignSeat function, we get MachineID/SellerID & PassengerID from global array.
We generate random number between 1 & 3 for randomly selected bus.

Once bus is selected, it is checked whether it is filled or not via *SeatNotFound Function. If not filled random seat numbers are generated, then corresponding global array is checked if its filled or not. If not filled(fill it), otherwise repeat it.
It is repeated for each bus

*SEATNOTFOUND FUNCTION

Takes BusID & Global Array.
Counts for corresponding number of occupied seats in respected bus & respective array range.
If count==12, returns filled, else not filled
